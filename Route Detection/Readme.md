# Bus route detection for blind people.

## Objective

Use the knowledge seen in class and within the area of computer vision systems to know how to design and implement this type of systems under controlled conditions and in real environments.

## Problematic

Currently, the Mexican government does very little for people with visual disabilities, so a device that helps them take public transport will be very useful for them. In some cities of the Mexican Republic, they have facilities that help people with visual disabilities to be more easily guided at the time of walking, but currently, it is difficult to reach our destination simply by walking, that is why helping them to use transportation public to provide them with some of their problems.

## Solution

The project consists of integrating a system that recognizes urban trucks in the street, that identifies which route is and so, that helps blind people to be more independent when using public transport. This thanks to the development of a tool that uses image processing for route detection.
